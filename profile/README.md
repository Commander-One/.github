☁️ **Integrated Cloud Storage**: Connect directly to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, FTP/SFTP, and more as if they were local folders.

## About Commander One
Commander One is a professional-grade file manager inspired by the classic Norton Commander interface, reimagined for the modern computing era. It provides users with an efficient two-pane view that dramatically simplifies complex file operations—such as synchronizing folders, searching across multiple locations, or bulk renaming—by making source and destination always visible. This approach is a powerful alternative to traditional single-pane file explorers, favored by power users, developers, and IT administrators who need precise control over their file systems. Beyond local files, it seamlessly integrates a wide array of network and cloud protocols, effectively becoming a universal hub for all your data, regardless of where it's stored.

The application is built with extensibility and customization at its core. It supports customizable hotkeys, extensive file viewing modes (including thumbnails and detailed lists), a built-in terminal emulator for quick command-line access, and a powerful search tool with regex support. For developers, features like root access (on supported systems), mount manager, and the ability to connect to remote servers via various protocols make it an indispensable tool for system management and web development. Commander One transforms file management from a mundane task into a streamlined, powerful process, saving time and reducing the complexity of handling large volumes of data across different storage mediums.
